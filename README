dcStatefulSecurity plugin
=========================

The `dcStatefulSecurityPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides authorization
features above the standard security feature of symfony.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

    * PEAR

            $ symfony plugin:install dcStatefulSecurityPlugin

    * Subversion

            $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/dcStatefulSecurityPlugin/trunk dcStatefulSecurityPlugin

  * Insert the filter

        [yml]
        rendering: ~
        security:  ~

        # insert your own filters here
        state:
          class: dcStatefulSecurityFilter

        cache:     ~
        common:    ~
        execution: ~

    Optionally, you can set the default policy:

        [yml]
        state:
          class: dcStatefulSecurityFilter
          param:
            default_policy: allow # or disallow

    Default policy gives you the posibility of allow or disallow actions that are not defined in the user class.

  * Clear you cache

        $ symfony cc

  * Define the user permissions based on object states (and user credentials, why not?).

      For example, supose that we have the person module, so, we can disallow the user to edit persons that
      are blocked (supose that a person is blocked if an attribute 'is_blocked' is set to true)

        [php]
        // in myUser.class.php
        public function canEditPerson($person)
        {
          return !$person->isBlocked();
        }
